    <p>QuickFIX also has a scriptable test runner that comes with a
    series of automated acceptance test. The basic tests that come
    with QuickFIX are based off of the <a href=
    "http://www.fixprotocol.org/ORGANIZATIONS/928202077/FIX_TestCase_SessionLevel20010710.doc">
    FIX Session-level Test Cases and Expected Behaviors</a>
    document produced by the FIX protocol organization. These tests
    verify that QuickFIX adheres to the FIX specifications. The
    automated nature of these tests guarantees that future releases
    of QuickFIX will not break any current functionality.</p>

    <p>Perhaps even more importantly is how these test are used to
    drive the development of QuickFIX. Before a line of code is
    written in support of a protocol feature, one of these tests is
    written. This test first approach sets up a goal for developers
    who will have objective verification that they correctly
    implemented the standard.</p>

    <p>Below is an example of a test script that tests the engines
    behavior when it receives a NewSeqNo value that is less than
    the expected MsgSeqNum.</p>

</pre>In these script there are two types of commands, action
commands and messages commands. Action commands begin with
lowercase letters while message command begin with uppercase
letters.

    <h2>Action Commands</h2><b>i&lt;ACTION&gt;</b> - initiates an
    action<br>
    <b>e&lt;ACTION&gt;</b> - expect (wait for) an action<br>
    <br>
    Supported actions are:<br>
    <br>
    <b>iCONNECT</b> - initiate connection to a FIX acceptor<br>
    <b>eCONNECT</b> - expect a connection from a FIX initiator<br>
    <b>iDISCONNECT</b> - initiate a disconnect<br>
    <b>eDISCONNECT</b> - expect a disconnect<br>
    <br>

    <h2>Message Commands</h2><b>I&lt;MESSAGE&gt;</b> - initiate
    (send) a message<br>
    <b>E&lt;MESSAGE&gt;</b> - expect (wait for) a message<br>
    <br>

    <p>When using the <b>I</b> command, you do not need to add the
    <i>Length(9)</i> or the <i>CheckSum(10)</i> fields, they will
    be added for you with the correct values in the appropriate
    locations. The only time you would add these fields is if you
    intentionally wish to make them incorrect.</p>

    <p>The <b>I</b> command also provides a TIME macro for fields.
    By setting a field equal to &lt;TIME&gt;, the current system
    time will be placed in the field. (i.e. 52=&gt;TIME&gt;). You
    can also use offsets such as 52=&lt;TIME-120&gt; or
    52=&lt;TIME+15&gt; in order to set the time plus or minus some
    seconds from the current time.</p>

    <p>The <b>E</b> command verifies that you have received the
    correct message. This command will compare the values of each
    field to make sure they are correct. Some fields cannot be
    verified deterministically before run-time such as the
    SendingTime and CheckSum fields. These fields can be added to
    the <i>fields.fmt</i> file where a regular expression can be
    defined to at least verify the field is in the correct format.
    For example:</p>10=\d{3}, checksum must be exactly three
    digits<br>
    52=\d{8}-\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}, sending time must be in the form of
    DDDDDDDD-DD:DD:DD where D is a digit.

    <p>Either command can contain a FILE macro which puts the
    contents of a file into a field (i.e.
    58=&lt;FILE:test.txt&gt;)</p>
